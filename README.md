# Statistical Arbitrage Pairs Selection for Gold
Arbitrage means difference in prices within/across the markets. The simple example is retail arbitrage. Statistical Arbitrage (Pair Trading) a pair trade is the taking of a long position in one security together with an equal short position in another that is strongly correlated with it. i.e. pocketing a small difference by taking position in multiple assets. For that, one has to study the historical price patterns and to take the position when it makes maximum sense statistically to take that position. In our project the pair selection of gold has been considered. Initially the price values (datasets) of the gold for all the twelve months of the last five years from 2020 are taken as the inputs.  The data analysis is made by deleting the null and negative values by using python programming. After that the difference between two months has been found out, to compute whether the month has reached the profit or loss. Thus, this profit or loss will give the position of the month. The graph has been plotted by placing the years along the x-axis and price along y-axis. From the graph, it is shown that the month of March, 2015 has attained maximum profit than the month of April, 2015.
